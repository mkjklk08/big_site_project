            <p>Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But <br> when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.</p>
            <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion <br> for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

            <p>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided <br> between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles <br> and Tokyo.</p>
            <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We <br> come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are <br> self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each <br> of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music <br> culture.</p>

            <p>We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments.<br> We only work on a few products and we strive to make them great.</p>
            <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their <br> magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly <br> diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree <br> with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

            <p>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge <br> and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development <br> and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>
